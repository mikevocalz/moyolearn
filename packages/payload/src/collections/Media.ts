  /*
    VERSIONS OFF — this canary defaults them ON (see Leads.ts), and for a
    collection holding learner content that default silently breaks the erasure
    cascade promised by docs 19 and 24.

    Payload mirrors every write into `_<table>_v`, and the retention sweep
    targets `expires_at` on the MAIN table only. So a transcript survives its own
    deletion in the shadow table: "delete my child's data" does not delete it.
    Disk growth is the symptom; the broken guarantee is the defect, and it is the
    one a district's counsel asks about.

    Measured before turning it off: 1,294 shadow rows across the schema, with
    `_student_model_facts_v_texts` holding 1,119 against 49 live — a 23x copy of
    derived learner facts that nothing was ever going to sweep.

    Versions are an editorial feature: draft/publish, revert, who-changed-what.
    None of that applies to an append-only record of a child's session.
