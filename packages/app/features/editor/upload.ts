 *
 * This also unblocks inline audio. The editor is a span-based EditText: an
 * inline node is a Drawable, and `setImage` accepts only an http(s) URL or a
 * file on disk (see EnrichedImageSpan.prepareDrawableForImage). A voice note
 * has no picture of its own, which is why it could not go inline while a video
 * could — YouTube hosts a thumbnail. Once the server returns a rendered
 * waveform image, audio becomes inline by exactly the same mechanism.
